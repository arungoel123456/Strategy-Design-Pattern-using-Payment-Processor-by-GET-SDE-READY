# Strategy Design Pattern

Problem Statement: Payment Processor Implementation

You are tasked with designing a flexible and scalable payment processor for an e-commerce platform. The platform supports multiple payment methods like Credit Card, PayPal, and UPI, and more methods may be added in the future.

Requirements:
1. Ensure that the addition of new payment methods doesnâ€™t require changes to the existing codebase.
2. Allow customers to switch between payment methods seamlessly.
3. Write clean, maintainable, and reusable code to handle payment processing logic.

Key Considerations:
Use the Strategy design pattern to encapsulate the payment methods' behaviors.
Implement an interface or abstract class for all payment methods.
Provide an easy-to-use mechanism for the client to select and execute the desired payment strategy.
